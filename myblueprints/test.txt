In related precision sports, Doron and Gaudreau analyzed point-by-point performance in elite fencing and showed that serial dependencies are nonstationary within matches, with winning streaks characterized by higher perceived control, more task-oriented coping, and lower negative affect compared with losing streaks or nonstreak periods. This process-oriented approach illustrates how immediate performance outcomes shape athletes’ psychological states and offers a framework that can be extended to darts, where sequential dependencies and “hot hand”–like effects have also been documented.
